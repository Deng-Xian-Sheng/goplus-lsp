# goplus lsp

goplus Language Server Protocol (LSP).

# ⚠️ Warning

**I fail! not use!**

It doesn't work yet!

No version was released

# What is it

GoPlus is a Golang-based programming language developed by China Qiniu Cloud with a syntax similar to Python.

But it doesn't have LSP yet, and I'm going to change GoLang's GOPLS to GOPLUS's LSP.

This may fail, but how do you know without trying?

If the first version of this repository is released, it is considered a success.
